    "paragraph2": "If we need a strain gauge, we select the number 1 (strain gauge serial number), select the strain gauge under the layout, and select the weight of the weight.",
    "paragraph3": "If we need a temperature sensor, we select the number 2 (the temperature sensor's serial number), select the temperature sensor under the layout and press <Start>, wait a few seconds, after which the graph is built.",
    "paragraph4": "If we need a photoresistor, we choose the number 4 (the photoresistor serial number), choose the photoresistor under the layout, choose the area of ​​the circle.",
    "paragraph5": "To reset all results and repeat the experiment, you need to reload the page."
